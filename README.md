# arduino-cpp-projects
A collection of Arduino Uno projects written in C++ for learning embedded systems development.

## Overview
This repository contains various Arduino projects implemented in C++ to explore embedded programming concepts. The goal is to understand low-level hardware interaction, memory management, and efficient code practices for embedded development.

Since the goal is to learn C++ for embedded systems, some of the projects also contain a version of the code written in the Arduino language (.ino). Most of the projects could have been written in C, but since C++ is compatible, I chose it.

## Projects
blink - Classic LED blink, exploring GPIO control and timing
tmp36 - Temperature sensor reading with ADC operations
More projects coming...
